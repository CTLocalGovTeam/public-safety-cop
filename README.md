### [Public Safety Common Operational Picture](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4d5a8964c9c54b07af7317b9c9ac86fd) ###
from Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team

Public Safety Common Operational Picture (COP) offers a standard overview of an incident, providing incident information that
enables the Incident Commander/Unified Command and any supporting agencies and organizations to make effective, consistent,
and timely decisions. It is a configuration of ArcGIS Viewer for Flex that can be used by emergency management staff in an
Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

This repository contains the collection of widgets that make up the application. Please see the
<a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4d5a8964c9c54b07af7317b9c9ac86fd">application description page</a>
for an example of how these widgets might be used in an application. The page also offers a link to a live try-it of
the application.

These widgets use the 3.0 version of
<a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/flex-api/">Esri's ArcGIS API for Flex</a>
and the 4.6 version of
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html">Adobe's Flex SDK</a>.
