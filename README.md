About the Public Safety Common Operational Picture App
===================================================
**from [Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/local-government/)**

Public Safety Common Operational Picture (COP) offers a standard overview of an incident, providing incident information that enables the Incident Commander/Unified Command and any supporting agencies and organizations to make effective, consistent, and timely decisions. It is a configuration of ArcGIS Viewer for Flex that can be used by emergency management staff in an Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
