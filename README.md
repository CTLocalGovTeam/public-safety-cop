About the Public Safety Common Operational Picture App
===================================================
**from [Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/local-government/)**

Public Safety Common Operational Picture (COP) offers a standard overview of an incident, providing incident information that enables the Incident Commander/Unified Command and any supporting agencies and organizations to make effective, consistent, and timely decisions. It is a configuration of ArcGIS Viewer for Flex that can be used by emergency management staff in an Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

How To Use
----------

This repository contains the collection of widgets that make up the application. Please see the [application description page](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4d5a8964c9c54b07af7317b9c9ac86fd) for an example of how these widgets might be used in an application.  The page also offers a link to a live try-it of the application.

These widgets use the 3.0 version of [Esri's ArcGIS API for Flex](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/flex-api/) and the 4.6 version of [Adobe's Flex SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html); see the site for concepts, samples, and a reference for using the API to create mapping web sites.
